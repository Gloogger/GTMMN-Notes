\colorbox{black}{\textbf{\color{white}Turbulence Models}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard $k-\varepsilon$, RNG $k-\varepsilon$, Realizable $k-\varepsilon$, Standard $k-\omega$, Transition SST, and Reynold Stress model are RANS-based Model.
    \item Detached Eddy Simulation and Large Eddy Simulation are not RANS based Model.
    \item The most accurate RANS turbulence model in terms of drag coefficient w.r.t. air flowing over a cylinder body is \textbf{\color{orange}Transition SST Model}, which is better in the following aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item convergence and stability
        \item performs better for high speed flows
        \item combines the fine features of both $k-\varepsilon$ and $k-\omega$ models (at free-stream and near wall regions respectively)
        \item Transition SST requires fine mesh near the wall region
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
